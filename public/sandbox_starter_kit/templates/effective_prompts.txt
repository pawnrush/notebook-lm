EFFECTIVE PROMPTS FOR NOTEBOOKLM IN SPECIAL EDUCATION
===================================================

**IMPORTANT: These are example prompts for practice. Always use de-identified data when working with real student information.**

BASIC PROMPT STRUCTURE
======================

Template: "As a [role], analyze [context] to [task]. Please [output specifications] while considering [constraints]."

Example: "As a special education teacher, analyze this reading assessment data to identify patterns in phonics skills development. Please provide a summary of strengths and areas for growth, formatted as bullet points, while considering interventions appropriate for a general education classroom setting."

BEGINNER PROMPTS (WEEK 1-2)
===========================

Data Analysis:
"Summarize the key findings from this assessment data. What are the student's main strengths and areas that need support?"

Goal Development:
"Create an IEP goal for reading fluency based on this student's current performance of 42 words correct per minute. Make it specific and measurable."

Simple Communication:
"Write a brief, positive email to parents explaining their child's progress in math this quarter."

Basic Behavior Analysis:
"Look at this behavior tracking data and tell me when the challenging behavior happens most often."

INTERMEDIATE PROMPTS (WEEK 3-4)
===============================

Comprehensive Analysis:
"Based on this assessment data for a 4th-grade student with dyslexia, analyze the pattern of strengths and needs across phonics, fluency, and comprehension. Identify the most critical area for intervention focus."

SMART Goal Creation:
"Using this baseline data showing a student reading 42 WCPM with 91% accuracy, create a SMART annual IEP goal for reading fluency that includes baseline, target criteria, evaluation method, and timeline."

Professional Communication:
"Draft a professional email to the IEP team requesting a meeting to discuss concerns about a student's lack of progress in reading. Include specific data points and suggested agenda items."

Intervention Planning:
"Based on this functional behavior assessment data suggesting the behavior serves an escape function, recommend three evidence-based interventions that can be implemented in a general education classroom with 25 students."

ADVANCED PROMPTS (WEEK 5+)
==========================

Multi-Source Analysis:
"Synthesize information from these multiple assessment reports, classroom observations, and parent input to create a comprehensive present levels of performance statement that addresses academic, functional, and behavioral domains."

Complex Goal Development:
"Develop three interconnected IEP goals for this student that address reading decoding, fluency, and comprehension while considering how these skills support access to 4th-grade science and social studies content."

Strategic Communication:
"Create a comprehensive communication plan for a challenging IEP meeting that includes: pre-meeting parent contact, meeting agenda with time allocations, talking points for addressing disagreements, and follow-up action steps."

Comprehensive Intervention Design:
"Design a multi-tiered intervention plan for this student's reading difficulties that includes: Tier 2 small group instruction details, Tier 3 intensive intervention components, progress monitoring schedule, and criteria for making instructional changes."

PROMPT CHAINING EXAMPLES
========================

Example 1: Complete Goal Development Process
1. "Analyze this assessment data to identify the three most critical areas of need."
2. "For each identified area, create a specific, measurable IEP goal."
3. "Suggest evidence-based interventions for the highest priority goal."
4. "Design a progress monitoring plan for tracking improvement."
5. "Create an implementation timeline with specific milestones."

Example 2: Behavior Intervention Development
1. "Analyze this ABC data to identify patterns in antecedents and consequences."
2. "Based on these patterns, hypothesize the function of this behavior."
3. "Recommend interventions that address the hypothesized function."
4. "Create a behavior intervention plan with prevention and response strategies."
5. "Design a data collection system to monitor intervention effectiveness."

ROLE-BASED PROMPTING
====================

Reading Specialist Perspective:
"As a reading specialist with expertise in dyslexia interventions, analyze this student's phonological processing assessment results and recommend a systematic intervention sequence that addresses phonemic awareness, phonics, and fluency needs."

Behavior Analyst Perspective:
"As a board-certified behavior analyst, review this functional behavior assessment data and develop a comprehensive behavior support plan that includes environmental modifications, replacement behavior teaching, and reinforcement strategies."

Occupational Therapist Perspective:
"As an occupational therapist, analyze this student's fine motor and sensory processing assessment data to recommend classroom accommodations and intervention strategies that support handwriting and attention to task."

CONTEXT-SPECIFIC PROMPTS
========================

Elementary Setting:
"For a 2nd-grade student in a class of 22 students with one teacher and no aide, suggest reading interventions that can be implemented during centers time with available classroom materials."

Middle School Setting:
"For a 7th-grade student with autism in an inclusion setting, recommend social skills interventions that can be embedded into regular classroom activities without drawing unwanted attention."

High School Setting:
"For an 11th-grade student with intellectual disability, design a transition-focused math curriculum that teaches functional money skills while addressing IEP goals for number sense and problem-solving."

AUDIENCE-SPECIFIC PROMPTS
=========================

For Parents:
"Explain this student's executive functioning challenges in parent-friendly language that helps them understand how to support homework completion at home."

For General Education Teachers:
"Create a one-page summary of accommodations and strategies for this student that a substitute teacher could easily understand and implement."

For Administrators:
"Summarize the resource allocation needs for this student's IEP implementation, including personnel time, materials, and space requirements."

QUALITY CONTROL PROMPTS
=======================

Content Review:
"Review this IEP goal for clarity, measurability, and appropriateness. Suggest specific improvements to make it more effective."

Professional Tone Check:
"Revise this email to parents to ensure it maintains a professional, collaborative tone while clearly communicating concerns about their child's progress."

Accuracy Verification:
"Check this behavior intervention plan for alignment with evidence-based practices and feasibility of implementation in the described setting."

TROUBLESHOOTING PROMPTS
=======================

When Responses Are Too General:
"Provide specific, step-by-step implementation instructions for this reading intervention, including materials needed, time requirements, and data collection procedures."

When Responses Lack Context:
"Adapt these intervention recommendations for a student who also has ADHD and sensory processing difficulties, considering the need for movement breaks and sensory supports."

When Responses Are Inappropriate:
"Revise these suggestions to ensure they are appropriate for a public school setting with limited resources and align with evidence-based practices in special education."

PROMPT REFINEMENT STRATEGIES
============================

Add Specificity:
- Instead of: "Help with this student's behavior"
- Try: "Analyze this ABC data for a 5th-grade student to identify triggers for task avoidance during independent work time"

Include Constraints:
- Instead of: "Suggest reading interventions"
- Try: "Suggest reading interventions that can be implemented in a general education classroom with 28 students, using materials available in most elementary schools"

Specify Output Format:
- Instead of: "Create an IEP goal"
- Try: "Create an IEP goal formatted with: baseline data, specific skill target, measurement criteria, evaluation method, and timeline"
