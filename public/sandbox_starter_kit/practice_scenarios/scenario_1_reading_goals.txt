RECOMMENDED ANNUAL GOALS
========================

Based on this comprehensive assessment data, the IEP team should consider goals in the following areas:

3. Reading Comprehension Goal

PRACTICE PROMPTS FOR NOTEBOOKLM
==============================

Use this scenario data to practice:

1. "Analyze this assessment data to identify the student's primary reading needs and strengths."

2. "Based on this data, create three SMART IEP goals for reading that are appropriate for this student's current performance level."

3. "Suggest evidence-based interventions that would support progress toward these reading goals."

4. "Create a progress monitoring plan for tracking improvement in reading fluency."

5. "Write a present levels of performance statement that summarizes this student's current reading abilities."

6. "Develop talking points for the IEP meeting that highlight both strengths and areas of need."

7. "Suggest accommodations that would support this student's access to grade-level content."

8. "Create a summary for parents that explains their child's reading profile in accessible language."
